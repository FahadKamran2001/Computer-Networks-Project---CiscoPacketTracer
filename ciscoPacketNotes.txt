Router -> 2811
Switch -> 2960 - 24TT
wires:
	1) Serial DTE -> 2 routers
	2) Copper Crossover -> like devices (same layer)
			    -> router ->laptop/PC
	3) Copper Straight-Through -> different layer
- router is layer 3
- switch is layer 2
- switch can have as many links
- To connect router to layer we use copper straight through denoted by continuous link
- router to laptop/PC we use straight-through denoted drawing like -----
- router for 2 interface needs WIC-1ENET interface card which allows 1 more
interface so the router can handle 1+1=2 interfaces
-router to router we use card WIC-2T

192.16.1.0/24
- the 192 is the number in a class
- /24 means 24 bits are representing the network and remaining represent the host
- A class range = 0-127
- B class range = 128-191
- C class range = 192-223
- further classes are reserved
- we will use class C IP (starting from 192 ending at 223)
- each connection with a router has unique network
- to change networks for router, change one of the 3 network eg change 192.16.1.0 to 192.16.2.0 or 192.17.1.0 or 193.16.1.0
- in host ip (the last point(.), we cant give 0 since it belongs to the network and cant give 255 since it belongs to the broadcast IP
- we give one more fix ip to gateway eg network is 192.16.1.0 and gateway is 192.16.1.1

FOR GIVING NETWORK TO GATEWAY ON ROUTER eg when network of router is 192.168.1.0
- interface fa 0/0 
- ip address (then write gateway network, gateway is the first 3 parts of ip of router = 192.168.1) 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0(this is the subnet mask(SM))


for ip router over serial
-we route to every end network on the other side of the serial cable along with the wire id 
eg> ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 se0/3/0

for class A
eg ip 11.1.1.1
network address is 11.0.0.0 subnet mask 255.0.0.0
broadcast address is 11.255.255.255

for class B
eg 131.1.1.1 subnet mask 255.255.0.0
network address is 131.1.0.0
broadcast address is 11.1.255.255

vlsm(variable length subnet mask)(it is classless)
