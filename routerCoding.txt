afterward close router terminal and click on the PC connected with the gate way
go to desktop ( do same for 2nd interface with their own gateway , do nothing for switch)
click on ip configuration
enter any ip with host .2 to .254 any (unused)
enter the default gate way it connects to the PC (here is 192.168.1.1)

for dynamic routing
click on router

show ip route
enable
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
network (ip of network)(do for all networks after C upto before the subnet mask, eg 1.0.0.0
no auto-summary


-for eigrp routing
Eigrp: (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

enable
show ip route
configure terminal 
router eigrp AS_number (Autonomous System number - this can be any number of range 1 to 65535; same for all the router)
network NA
no auto-summary

Note: If two routers belong to different AS_, they will not share routing information.




-for ospf routing
OSPF: (Open Shortest Path First)  

enable
show ip route
configure terminal 
router ospf PROCESS_ID
network Network_address  WILDCARD_MASK  AREA 10

Note: Note that the OSPF process ID doesnâ€™t have to be the same on all routers in order for the routers 
to establish a neighbor relationship, but the area parameter has to be the same on all neighboring routers 
in order for the routers to become neighbors.

-for vlsm(variable length subnet mask)
on router

enable
configure terminal
interface fa0/0
ip address (the ip addressw with subnet mask)
ip helper-address (only ip of server)
no shutdown

natting

put device ip to static and use the private ip

enable
config terminal
interface (interface of private ip device)
ip nat inside
exit
interface se0/3/1
ip nat outside
exit
ip nat inside source static 172.17.217.2(private ip of device) 76.8.178.72(gateway of se0/3/1)
